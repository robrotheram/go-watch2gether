# Watch2gether
Yet another video sync website it currently support Youtube, DailyMotion Vimeo Soundcloud and Videos hosted on your own fileserver that you totally legally ownðŸ˜‰

## Why? 
This project spun out of my quest to find something that would allow my group of friends watch vidoes together from the random collection of YouTube clips to long movies. All other services did not support playing mp4 files or had features that were not required for example chat. This is little webapp does not need API keys to be set up and users do not need to create any accouts. Just create a room share a link and people can join. 

## Features
### Listen In discord
